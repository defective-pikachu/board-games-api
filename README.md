# Board Games API

Welcome to Michael's Board Games API! This readme file will be maintained and updated throughout the project. 

## Hosted Project

The hosted project can be found at: https://michael-games-app.herokuapp.com/

## What is the Project?

The project is an API which allows a user to interact with a database through their browser. The API accesses application data programmatically, with the intention of mimicking real-world back end services (i.e. Reddit) which provide information to front end architecture.

The project interacts with a PSQL database using node-postgres.

The database itself is populated with four tables. These contain information about board games, board game reviews, users who own those board games, and comments on the board game reviews. The four tables relate to each other in such a way that a request may be made which requests combined information from each table and returns aggregate data. 

The endpoints.json file details the various endpoints contained within the project. It contains examples of what a request made to each endpoint might return.

The project aims to demonstrate my understanding of application programming interfaces and my ability to write and test code effectively. The project contains comprehensive error-handling in order to make the API as functional and user-friendly as possible.

## Setting Up API

If you would like to use this API, you can git clone it. To do this, navigate to https://github.com/cremedelakremlin/board-games-api. Once there, click the Code drop down button, and copy the displayed https link or click "Open with GitHub Desktop" if you are a desktop app user. If you have copied the link, navigate to your desired directory within your terminal, and enter "git clone <<URL>>". You should then be able to open the repo in VS Code or your code editing software of choice.

Once open, run "npm install" to install project dependencies locally. This will install the following dependencies necessary for the repo to function:

- dotenv
- express
- jest-extended
- pg
- pg-format
- supertest

Additionally, you will need to run the following command to install Husky and jest-sorted:

- npx husky-init && npm install
- npm install â€”save-dev jest-sorted

Finally, you will need to add "jest-sorted" to your package.json file, under jest > setupFilesAfterEnv

Next you will need to seed your local database. This can be done by running the command "npm setup-dbs" and then "npm run seed". To run the test files, you can either run the command "npm t" or choose to run specific test files by copying the relative path from the files in the __tests__ folder and then running "npm t <<file_name>>.


## Developer files

In order to connect locally to either of the two databases contained within this project, user will need to create .env.test and .env.development files for their project. Once these have been created, a user should add "PGDATABASE=<database_name_here>" to each of these files. The correct database name for each can be found within /db/setup.sql. The user should check that these .env files are .gitignored. This can be done by adding ".env.*" to the .gitignore file.

## Minimum Requirements

The following versions of node.js and postgres are needed:

node: v16.16.0
postgres: v14.5
